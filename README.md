# MudDataGridAndTableSample
This is a sample CRUD application using MudBlazor components MudDataGrid and MudTable.

The sample uses StartEditingItem to edit the MudDataGrid, but as of February 2023, it is still recommended to avoid specifying the same functionality because some validation does not work.
